# deepnest-next: for the community - from the community

This is a community-based organization that maintains a deepnest fork.<br>
The original deepnest author has stopped maintaining deepnest and is not responding.<br>
We are now trying to bring the somewhat dusty project up to date and adapt it to the times.
If you are interested in supporting us, throw a PR over the fence and/or get involved in issues or discussions.

## Projects we are working on

### Our currently published projects
- [deepnest](https://github.com/deepnest-next/deepnest) - Our Main App to run the nesting.
- [node-calculateNFP](https://github.com/deepnest-next/node-calculateNFP) - One Core component that we use to calculate the No Fit Polygon (NFP).
- [node-svg-preprocessor](https://github.com/deepnest-next/node-svg-preprocessor) - an other core component that we use to normalize the SVG Data for processing within our App.

### Our projects that have not yet been published

We have several projects in the pipeline that will improve and accelerate the calculations. However, as we do not want to release any unfinished products and libraries, these are still private and are being tested internally.

Unfortunately, we also have some products that we will not release as open source, as we would like to offer some premium features to fund future development.

- *node-dxf2svg-processor* - Our node and electron module, to convert dxf2svg and svg2dxf. A future core module.
- *core* - A new development of the current core source code, which we are developing to make it easier for future contributors to add new features.
