# deepnest-next: for the community - from the community

This is a community-based organization that maintains a deepnest fork.

The original deepnest author has stopped maintaining deepnest and is not responding.

We are now trying to bring the somewhat dusty project up to date and adapt it to the times.

If you are interested in supporting us, throw a PR over the fence and/or get involved in issues or discussions.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

We are not responsible for the domain deepnest.io. The original developer has not pursued the development of deepnest for some time.
