# Statement: Why we forked the [@deepnest-io/Deepnest](https://github.com/deepnest-io/Deepnest)

I don't really want to write too much about this, as I'm not directly involved in the matter. BUT if a user with two accounts:

```
  "login": "abebeos",
  "id": 165260843,
  "created_at": "2024-03-28T08:34:11Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-12-12T17:04:50Z"


and

  "login": "lazaridiscom",
  "id": 62181287,
  "created_at": "2020-03-14T15:33:46Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-07-19T11:50:07Z"
```

takes over an organisation maliciously and with blackmail and "expropriates" the previous owners he had worked for. I see it somewhat differently.

@abebeos was once a Freelander who was hired for [@deepnest-io/Deepnest](https://github.com/deepnest-io/Deepnest) to make changes, but after more than a year the former Freelancer woke up and took over the organisation. He then removed all members, at that time I was the last Mohican to have member status in addition to his two accounts.

After I spoke to him about his behaviour, he was as always cheeky, dismissive and rude. In one message he wanted 10,000 euros for the handover of the organisation, later he wanted between 3,000 and 5,000 euros, in his last message it was 2,000 euros that he wanted from the former client so that the organisation could be returned to the original hands.

Unfortunately, I don't have screenshots of everything... So unfortunately I have to reproduce from memory.

Perhaps it's better if I don't write any more, as I'm very disappointed at how frustrated one person must be to destroy everything that has been built up over the years. What happened today is that I was also removed from the organisation [@deepnest-io](https://github.com/deepnest-io), banned and previously banned several times. The branches that previously contained a few more commits have now also been reset. There are currently 172 commits remaining from the previous 190?

I wish you all to find your way here and open a new chapter together with us. To develop this great work of various contributors even further and make it bigger.
